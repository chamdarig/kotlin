Note: If you don't provide an initial value when you declare a variable, you must specify the type.

In this line of code, no initial value is provided, so you must specify the data type:

val count: Int

In this line of code, an assigned value is provided, so you can omit the data type:

val count = 2
*/
val count = 2
